# proRate

The main purpose of this R package is to provide functions used to infer RNA Polymerase II (PolII) elongation rate from Pro-seq/Gro-seq bam files using a novel least sum of square (LSS) method, which is simpler and more efficient than the tranditional hidden Markov model (HMM) based method.

While it also contains other functions including the ones to generate meta gene plot from bam files, calculate Pause index for RNA Polymerase II, as well as do several statistical analysis and structure analysis for the genes with various transcription rate levels identified by the LSS method in this R package.
